The benchmark involved reading data from a drive, processing it, and then saving the processed data (normalization task was used for this purpose). Two types of drives were tested: an internal SSD and a network folder on a server. Four distinct configurations were assessed: reading and writing both from the SSD (SSD_SSD), reading from the SSD and writing to the network folder (SSD_NET), reading from the network folder and writing to the SSD (NET_SSD), and reading and writing both from the network folder (NET_NET)."

The goal is to provide users with comparative insights into processing time, CPU, RAM, and disk usage across different tools and configurations. More importantly, benchmark results could help decide which processing parameters are most optimal given the dataset and workstation characteristics.\n\n\nPoint cloud processing tools offer a range of functionalities, often with overlapping capabilities. Users face decisions about which tool to use and how to configure settings for optimal performance. This project benchmarks several tools to guide these decisions.\n\n\n\n\nUniform Task Performance: Each tool is tested against standardized tasks to ensure comparable results.\nResource Utilization: We measure and record processing time, CPU and RAM usage.\nIterative Testing: Tools are tested under various conditions to assess performance impacts:\n\nDifferent numbers of workers (CPU cores/threads)\nVarious storage devices including local (SSD, HDD) and network drives\nDiverse input data characteristics\n\n\n\n\n\nThe benchmark uses a subset of ALS data acquired over the Petawawa research forest located in in Ontario, Canada.

This procedure was used to generate datasets with densities of 20, and 50 pts/m².
