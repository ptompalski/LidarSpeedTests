More importantly, benchmark results could help decide which processing parameters are most optimal given the dataset and workstation characteristics.\n\n\nPoint cloud processing tools offer a range of functionalities, often with overlapping capabilities.

Four distinct configurations were assessed: reading and writing both from the SSD (SSD_SSD), reading from the SSD and writing to the network folder (SSD_NET), reading from the network folder and writing to the SSD (NET_SSD), and reading and writing both from the network folder (NET_NET)."

    "text": "The complex tasks described below consist of multiple individual steps executed within a single processing workflow, closely simulating real-world scenarios. When processing point cloud data, routines often involve a series of tasks performed sequentially, where data is read, processed, and saved at each stage. However, lasR allows users to build processing pipelines where the input data is read only once. This approach significantly reduces the overall processing time."
