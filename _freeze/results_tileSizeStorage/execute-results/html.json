In addition to the 1000 m tile size used in all standard benchmark runs, three additional sizes were tested: 200, 500, and 2000 m. \n\n\n![](graphics/byTileSize.png)\n![](graphics/byTileSizeRel.png)\n\n## Influence of drive/storage type\n\nThis benchmark was aimed to evaluate the influence of drive configuration on processing time. The benchmark involved reading data from a drive, processing it, and then saving the processed data (`normalization` task was used for this purpose). Two types of drives were tested: an internal SSD and a network folder on a server. Four distinct configurations were assessed: reading and writing both from the SSD (`SSD_SSD`), reading from the SSD and writing to the network folder (`SSD_NET`), reading from the network folder and writing to the SSD (`NET_SSD`), and reading and writing both from the network folder (`NET_NET`). \n\n\n![](graphics/byDrives.png)\n\n\n![](graphics/byDrivesRel.png)",
